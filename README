== hpGEM ==

hpGEM is a c++ partial differential equation solver. It is intended for Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Methods, but can also do normal (conforming) Finite Element Methods and Finite Volume.

== Installation ==

For a quick, basis installation do

$ mkdir ../hpGEM_build
$ cd ../hpGEM_build
$ cmake ../trunk
$ make

== FAQ ==

Q: How do I use hpGEM?
A: There are a few tutorials provided in the applications folder.

Q: Where is the documentation?
A: There is documentation on the website. You can also locally build the documentation is you enable hpGEM_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION in cmake. The command for doing so is 'make doc'. It then becomes available in docs/html/index.html.

Q: How do I create my own application?
A: Copy one of the existing applications, or copy app1 if you want to start from an empty application. Then edit the copied CMakeLists.txt and change the two occurrences of app1.out to the desired name of your application

Q: I added an application, but it isn't detected!
A: CMake cannot automatically detect new applications. Please use generate in cmake-gui or ccmake or type cmake again.

Q: hpGEM is slow!
A: hpGEM is used by users of highly varying background and with highly varying programming skills. For this reason the (default) Debug configuration is extra paranoid about making sure all functions are used as intended. This safeguard drastically slows down computation. Setting CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release disables these safeguards and enables compiler optimisations. It is recommended that you validate that your application is working as intended before doing this.

Q: I tried to compile my code using -Wall or -Weverything because I am paranoid, but now it doesn't compile at all
A: -Wall and -Weverything override the -std=c++11 flag. Manually set it again after -Wall or -Weverything to re-enable c++11 features
